A Comprehensive Roadmap to Mathematics _(in progress)_

## Philosophy

### Problems with learning Mathematics
There are several problems with the way Mathematics is presented and taught today which causes confusion and struggle. In my opinion, the main problem is the way in which Mathematics is currently written. Mathematics is considered to be a deductive science, i.e., starts from first principles (called **Axioms** or **Postulates**) and a set of logical rules that are used to establish results (called **theorems**) from these first principles; hence, it is typically written in that systematic order to reflect its underlying logical structure. We don't mean from this that it is a "bad" way to write Mathematics in, and we would even say that this is how mathematics should be written "ideally". However, "ideally" doesn't imply "pedagogically best", that is, we don't "naturally" think within the bounds of the deductive method. This, also, doesn't imply that we will need to get entirely rid of writing deductively either, but to seek somewhere between logical rigor and effective pedagogy. Another major problem with current written Mathematics (which is related to the first problem) is the precedence of abstractions to concrete examples (or instances) which is isn't natural too.

### Objective
We don't intend here to offer solutions to the problems mentioned above; however, using the best _(pedagogically best)_ of available references, we wish to construct an effective roadmap for learning Mathematics which approximates our idea of good mathematical exposition.
