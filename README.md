A Comprehensive Roadmap to Mathematics _(in progress)_

## Philosophy

### Problems with learning Mathematics
There are several problems with the way Mathematics is presented and taught today which causes confusion and struggle. In my opinion, the main problem is the way in which Mathematics is currently written. Since Mathematics is considered to be a deductive science, i.e., begins with first principles (called *Axioms* or *Postulates*) and a set of logical rules to establish results (called *theorems*) from these first principles, it is typically written in thay way to reflect its underlying logical structure. I don't mean it is "bad" to write Mathematics in that way and I would even say that it is the "ideal" way to write Mathematics in. However, "ideal" doesn't imply "pedagogically best", that is, we don't "naturally" think within the bounds of the deductive method. This, also, doesn't imply that we will need to get entirely rid of writing deductively either. Another major problem with current written Mathematics (which is related to the first problem) is starting with abstractions and then providing examples (or instances) of the abstract concept which is not natural too.
