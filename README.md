A Comprehensive Roadmap to Mathematics _(in progress)_

## Audience
This roadmap is primarily intended for students of Mathematics. This doesn't necessarily mean that students from other disciplines such as Physics and Computer Science won't benefit from it; however, looking at the roadmap could be overwhelming for them, but this is because Mathematics has many areas and the roadmap was intended to be comprehensive to include them. 

## Philosophy

### Problems with learning Mathematics
There are several problems with the way Mathematics is presented and taught today which causes confusion and struggle. In my opinion, the main problem is the way in which Mathematics is currently written. Mathematics is considered to be a deductive science, i.e., starts from first principles (called **Axioms** or **Postulates**) and a set of logical rules that are used to establish results (called **Theorems**) from these first principles; hence, it is typically written in that systematic order to reflect its underlying logical structure. We don't mean from this that it is a "bad" way to write Mathematics in, and we would even say that this is how mathematics should be written "ideally". However, "ideally" doesn't imply "pedagogically best", that is, we don't "naturally" think within the bounds of the deductive method. This, also, doesn't imply that we will need to get entirely rid of writing deductively either, but to seek somewhere between logical rigor and effective pedagogy. Another major problem with current written Mathematics (which is related to the first problem) is the precedence of abstractions to concrete examples (or instances) which is isn't natural too.

### Objective
We don't intend here to offer solutions to the problems mentioned above; however, using the best _(pedagogically best)_ of available references, we wish to construct an effective and comprehensive roadmap for learning Mathematics which approximates our idea of good mathematical exposition.

### Learning Tips
Learning Mathematics is a tedious task that requires long periods of conscious effort and patience. We offer some tips which we consider to be of great importance when learning any subject within Mathematics (which could be applied elsewhere).

* The main goal of learning is to understand the ideas and concepts at hand as "deeply" as possible. Understanding is a mental process we go through to see how a new idea is related to previous ideas and knowledge. In this context, and as a proponent of Idealism and Brand Blanshard's philosophy, I must mention Blanshard's view on understanding, he sees that what is meant by understanding something is to see it as necessitated within a system of which it is a part. By "deeply" we mean to grasp as much of the ideas and relations between them as possible. A good metaphor for this is picturing knowledge as a web of ideas, the more dense the web is, the stronger it becomes. This implies that there might be no "perfect" state of understanding, and otherwise it is an on-going process. You could learn a subject and think you understand it completely, and after learning other subjects, you come back to the first subject to observe that you understand it deeper. As a famous quote from the mathematician John V. Neumann: "Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them", which I think really means that getting "used to" some topic in Mathematics might be the first step in the journey of its understanding!

* Motivation for any new concept is a must. This includes historical development of the subject which is sometimes crucial to understanding, analogies, drawings, and many other methods. Thought is induced by problems, questions, and misconceptions; thus, knowing what questions were asked in the mind of the mathematician who developed the subject and the problems he confronted really helps guiding thought in the right direction of understanding.

* Always question the way the subject is presented. This includes questioning everything from the way terms are defined, to the way theorems are proved, even questioning whether the subject deserves the time and effort mathematicians put to it. We could use a good quote here from the mathematician Pual Hamlos: "Don't just read it; fight it! Ask your own question, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?".

* Solve as many exercises as you can to challenge your understanding and problem-solving skills. Exercises can sometimes reveal weaknesses in your understanding. Unfortunately, there is no mathematical instruction manual for problem-solving, it is rather an essential skill that requires practice and develops by time. However, it could be greatly impacted by your level of understanding of the subject. The processes of learning and problem-solving are interrelated and no one of them is dispensable in the favor of the other.

* Be **metacognitive** (from **Metacognition** which literally means "beyond cognition", i.e., "beyond knowledge"), that is, be aware of your own thoughts and consciously think about how you think. Thought is not passive, but an active process that could reflect on itself. Metcognition and consciousness help us monitor and regulate our thought processes to increase our potential to learn and make us the able to evaluate our performance by utilizing past thought experience.
